I create a function called createNewFunction. I then create a placeholder newFunction that was gonna be whatever came out the bottom of running createNewFunction. Well, what came out the bottom was an entire function definition add2 returned out. I now use the new global label newFunction for that functionality add2, forming those add2 to run it, pass in 3, add2 to it, get out 5 and throw it in the global constant result. Everyone's thumbs, you lost me, I'm totally clear. I have a clarification. Your clarification might just be, why the hell do we do this?
