## Challenge 1

A) Create a for loop that iterates through an array and returns the sum of the elements of the array.
B) Create a functional iterator for an array that returns each value of the array when called, one element at a time.

## Challenge 2

Create an iterator with a next method that returns each value of the array when .next is called.

## Challenge 3

Write code to iterate through an entire array using your nextIterator and sum the values.

## Challenge 4

Create an iterator with a next method that returns each value of a set when .next is called

## Challenge 5

Create an iterator with a next method that returns an array with two elements (where the first element is the index and the second is the value at that index) when .next is called.

## Challenge 6

Create an iterator that returns each word from a string of words on the call of its .next method (hint: use regex!)
Then attach it as a method to the prototype of a constructor Words. Hint: research Symbol.iterator!

## Challenge 7

Build a function that walks through an array and returns the element concatenated with the string "was found after index x", where x is the previous index.
